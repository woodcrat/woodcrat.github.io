			<h2>Who are we?</h2>
				<p>
					Group 7 are a small team made up of computer scientists working through
					their degree at Aston University, Birmingham, UK. Working together
					since September 2017 we have been together for only a few months,
					however have been working on our first project - Battleships. The
					team is composed of 8 members, details of each are listed below. 
				</p>	
			<h2>Where are we and what do we do?</h2>
				<p>
					Logically, we are based out of Birmingham as formely mentioned, 
					we look to produce predominantly Java-based programs for use in 
					our university studies. The team isn't like others in the industry, 
					driven by education and self-development rather than pushing for 
					profits and promotion. We focus on working together as a team, 
					helping one another and trying to create the best products possible. 
				</p>
			<h2>Why use our products?</h2>
				<p>
					If considering why you should purchase from us? Simply, it's free. 
					We don't charge for our products and they are all open sourced and 
					freely downloadable from our GitHub repository.
