			<p>
				So what is the point in contacting us? We appreciate any feedback
				you can/may want to give us. We appreciate that the best form of 
				feedback comes from users using the software we're developing. Therefore,
				we want to give you a platform to do this. Currently our best form
				of communication is via email. You can report any bugs or issues
				you find in our software and we'll be sure to look into it. As well as
				this you can also inform us of any features	you would like to see implemented 
				or improved. Thanks from us in advance.
